# AVnu Base/ProAV Functional Interoperability Profile Configuration
# Based on AVnu Alliance Base and ProAV Functional Interoperability Specification 1.1
# Requirements: asCapable TRUE after 2-10 successful PDelay exchanges

[ptp]
# Profile Selection
profile = avnu_base

# Clock Quality Parameters (per AVnu Base specification)
priority1 = 248                    # Default application clock priority
clockClass = 248                   # Default application time
clockAccuracy = 0xFE               # Time accurate to within unspecified bounds
offsetScaledLogVariance = 0x4E5D   # Standard variance value

# Timing Intervals (log2 seconds)
announce_interval = 0              # 1 second (2^0)
sync_interval = 0                  # 1 second (2^0) 
pdelay_interval = 0                # 1 second (2^0)

# Neighbor propagation delay threshold (nanoseconds)
neighborPropDelayThresh = 800000   # 800 microseconds

# Sync receipt threshold
syncReceiptThreshold = 3

# Announce receipt timeout multiplier  
announceReceiptTimeoutMultiplier = 3

# AVnu Base Profile Notes:
# - asCapable starts FALSE and becomes TRUE after 2-10 successful PDelay exchanges
# - Standard BMCA operation
# - Enhanced link detection and timeout handling
# - Compatible with ProAV applications requiring reliable synchronization
