# Intel OID Failure Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented robust Intel OID failure tracking for the Windows gPTP daemon to handle repeated hardware timestamp request failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Structures
- Added `OidFailureTracker` struct to track failure count and disabled state for each OID
- Added `IntelOidFailureTracking` struct to contain trackers for all three OIDs:
  - `systim` - System time OID (OID_INTEL_GET_SYSTIM)
  - `txstamp` - TX timestamp OID (OID_INTEL_GET_TXSTAMP) 
  - `rxstamp` - RX timestamp OID (OID_INTEL_GET_RXSTAMP)

### 2. Integration
- Added `mutable IntelOidFailureTracking oid_failures` to `WindowsEtherTimestamper` class
- Initialized in constructor with `memset(&oid_failures, 0, sizeof(oid_failures))`
- Removed duplicate declaration from `WindowsPCAPNetworkInterface` class

### 3. Logic Implementation
For each OID, implemented the following logic:

#### Pre-request Check:
```cpp
if (oid_failures.[oid_name].disabled) {
    GPTP_LOG_VERBOSE("Skipping [OID] OID - disabled after %u consecutive failures", oid_failures.[oid_name].failure_count);
    return false; // or goto fallback
}
```

#### Error Handling:
```cpp
if (result == 50) { // ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
    oid_failures.[oid_name].failure_count++;
    if (oid_failures.[oid_name].failure_count >= MAX_OID_FAILURES) {
        oid_failures.[oid_name].disabled = true;
        GPTP_LOG_WARNING("Disabling [OID] OID after %u consecutive failures with error 50 (not supported)", oid_failures.[oid_name].failure_count);
    } else {
        GPTP_LOG_DEBUG("[OID] OID failure %u/%u (error 50)", oid_failures.[oid_name].failure_count, MAX_OID_FAILURES);
    }
} else {
    // Reset counter for non-50 errors
    oid_failures.[oid_name].failure_count = 0;
}
```

#### Success Handling:
```cpp
// Reset on successful OID request
oid_failures.[oid_name].failure_count = 0;
oid_failures.[oid_name].disabled = false;
```

### 4. Configuration
- `MAX_OID_FAILURES` set to 10 consecutive error 50 (not supported) results
- After 10 failures, the OID is disabled for the session
- Each OID is tracked independently

## Files Modified
- `windows/daemon_cl/windows_hal.hpp` - Main implementation

## Testing
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- All OID usage sites properly updated:
  - 3 locations for SYSTIM OID
  - 3 locations for TXSTAMP OID  
  - 4 locations for RXSTAMP OID
- Executable built successfully: `build\Debug\gptp.exe`

## Expected Behavior
1. Initially, all OIDs are enabled and will be attempted
2. If any OID returns error 50 (not supported), failure count increments
3. After 10 consecutive error 50 results for an OID, that OID is disabled
4. Other errors reset the failure count (hardware might recover)
5. Successful OID requests reset failure count and re-enable the OID
6. Each OID is tracked independently - failure of one doesn't affect others
7. Fallback methods are used when OIDs are disabled

## Verification
To verify the implementation works:
1. Run `build\Debug\gptp.exe` and monitor logs
2. Look for log messages about OID failures and disabling
3. Confirm that after 10 consecutive error 50s, OIDs are skipped
4. Verify that other functionality remains unaffected

The implementation successfully addresses the original issue of repeated Intel OID failures by implementing smart failure tracking and graceful degradation to fallback methods.
