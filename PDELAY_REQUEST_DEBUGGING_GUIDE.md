# PDelay Request Debugging Guide

## Overview

The gPTP daemon now includes comprehensive debugging for received PDelay request messages. This guide explains the debugging features available and how to use them effectively.

## Available Debugging Features

### 1. Enhanced PDelay Request Reception Debugging

**Location**: `common/ether_port.cpp` (lines ~305-325)

**Debug Output Example**:
```
INFO     : GPTP [07:56:39:175] *** RECEIVED PDelay Request - calling processMessage
STATUS   : GPTP [07:56:39:176] *** PDELAY DEBUG: Received PDelay Request seq=28313 from source
STATUS   : GPTP [07:56:39:177] *** PDELAY DEBUG: Source Clock ID: 00:0a:92:ff:fe:01:c2:eb, Port: 1
STATUS   : GPTP [07:56:39:177] *** PDELAY DEBUG: RX timestamp: 331.439297065
STATUS   : GPTP [07:56:39:178] *** PDELAY DEBUG: Port state: 13, asCapable: false
```

**Information Provided**:
- **Sequence ID**: Unique identifier for each PDelay request
- **Source Clock ID**: IEEE 802.1AS clock identity of the requesting device
- **Source Port Number**: Port number on the requesting device
- **RX Timestamp**: Precise reception timestamp in seconds.nanoseconds format
- **Port State**: Current state of the receiving port (13 = PTP_LISTENING)
- **asCapable Status**: Whether the port considers itself capable of participating in timing

### 2. PDelay Response Processing Debugging

**Location**: `common/ptp_message.cpp` (lines ~1244-1350)

**Debug Output Example**:
```
INFO     : GPTP [07:56:39:178] *** PTPMessagePathDelayReq::processMessage - START processing PDelay Request
STATUS   : GPTP [07:56:39:179] *** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: Processing request seq=28313
STATUS   : GPTP [07:56:39:179] *** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: Port state check - current state: 13
INFO     : GPTP [07:56:39:180] *** PTPMessagePathDelayReq::processMessage - passed state checks, creating response
STATUS   : GPTP [07:56:39:180] *** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: State checks passed - creating PDelay Response
```

**Information Provided**:
- **Processing start confirmation**: When PDelay request processing begins
- **State validation**: Checks that port is not disabled or faulty
- **Response creation confirmation**: When a PDelay response is generated

### 3. TX Lock and Response Transmission Debugging

**Debug Output Example**:
```
INFO     : GPTP [07:56:39:181] *** About to send PDelay Response - acquiring TX lock
INFO     : GPTP [07:56:39:181] *** TX lock acquired, calling sendPort
INFO     : GPTP [07:56:39:196] *** sendPort returned, releasing TX lock
INFO     : GPTP [07:56:39:197] *** TX lock released
```

**Information Provided**:
- **TX Synchronization**: Thread-safe transmission handling
- **Send Operation**: Confirmation that response transmission was attempted
- **Lock Management**: Proper resource management for concurrent access

## How to Enable Debugging

### Option 1: Use Debug Build (Recommended)

1. **Build Debug Version**:
   ```powershell
   cmake --build build --config Debug
   ```

2. **Run with Debug Output**:
   ```powershell
   # For Intel I210 adapter
   $mac = (Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.InterfaceDescription -like '*I210*' } | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty MacAddress)
   .\build\Debug\gptp.exe $mac
   
   # For any available adapter
   $mac = (Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object { $_.Status -eq 'Up' } | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty MacAddress)
   .\build\Debug\gptp.exe $mac
   ```

### Option 2: Use Validation Script

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "test_milan_compliance_validation.ps1"
```

## Interpreting Debug Output

### Normal Operation Sequence

1. **PDelay Request Reception**:
   ```
   *** RECEIVED PDelay Request - calling processMessage
   *** PDELAY DEBUG: Received PDelay Request seq=X from source
   ```

2. **Source Identification**:
   ```
   *** PDELAY DEBUG: Source Clock ID: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX, Port: N
   ```

3. **Timestamp Capture**:
   ```
   *** PDELAY DEBUG: RX timestamp: SSS.NNNNNNNNN
   ```

4. **State Validation**:
   ```
   *** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: Port state check - current state: N
   ```

5. **Response Generation**:
   ```
   *** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: State checks passed - creating PDelay Response
   ```

6. **Response Transmission**:
   ```
   *** About to send PDelay Response - acquiring TX lock
   *** TX lock acquired, calling sendPort
   *** sendPort returned, releasing TX lock
   *** TX lock released
   ```

### Error Conditions

#### Port Disabled
```
*** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: SKIPPED - port disabled
```

#### Port Faulty
```
*** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: RECOVERING - port faulty
```

#### Wrong Port Type
```
*** PDELAY RESPONSE DEBUG: FAILED - wrong port type
```

## Performance Analysis

### Timing Analysis Example

From the debug output, you can analyze:

1. **Inter-Request Timing**:
   - Request 1: `RX timestamp: 331.439297065`
   - Request 2: `RX timestamp: 331.890074265`
   - **Interval**: ~450ms (450.777ms actual)

2. **Processing Time**:
   - Start: `[07:56:39:178]`
   - Response sent: `[07:56:39:196]`
   - **Processing time**: ~18ms

3. **Sequence Tracking**:
   - Request 1: `seq=28313`
   - Request 2: `seq=28314`
   - **Proper incrementing**: ✅

## Milan Profile Compliance

The debugging also shows Milan profile compliance:

```
*** milan PROFILE: Setting asCapable=false (initial=false, link_up_behavior=false_initially)
*** ANNOUNCE MESSAGES WILL START AFTER EARNING asCapable ***
```

This confirms that:
- Milan profile starts with `asCapable=false` 
- Announce messages are deferred until asCapable is earned
- PDelay protocol must succeed 2+ times before asCapable becomes true

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. No PDelay Requests Received

**Symptoms**: No `*** RECEIVED PDelay Request` messages

**Possible Causes**:
- No peer devices on network
- Network isolation
- Packet capture issues
- Wrong MAC address specified

**Solution**: Verify network connectivity and peer devices

### 2. PDelay Requests Received but Not Processed

**Symptoms**: Reception debug messages but no processing messages

**Possible Causes**:
- Port state issues
- Profile configuration problems
- Threading issues

**Solution**: Check port state in debug output

### 3. Response Transmission Issues

**Symptoms**: Processing complete but transmission fails

**Possible Causes**:
- TX timestamp issues
- Network adapter problems
- Administrator privileges required

**Solution**: Run as Administrator for hardware timestamping

## Source Code Locations

- **Reception Debugging**: `common/ether_port.cpp` (processNetworkBuffer)
- **Processing Debugging**: `common/ptp_message.cpp` (PTPMessagePathDelayReq::processMessage)
- **Message Types**: `common/avbts_message.hpp` (MessageType enum)
- **Profile Configuration**: `common/gptp_profile.hpp` (gPTPProfile struct)
